As a general rule of thumb, lower growth rate values tend to look more like traditional 
logistic growth than chaotic growth. Note that values below approximately 1.7 also tend 
to settle into a a steady state due to rounding of population numbers to integers, but 
chaotic oscillations in this regime can be created with a large enough population. 

Negative populations are included so that the severity of a population crash can be
gauged by how far below zero the population crashes.

100 generations is reccomended for neater graphs that capture adequate behavior. If not
specified, the number of generations in the scenarios below is 100.

Fun parameters you can try out:

1. Logistic growth

Initial Population: 1000
Carrying Capacity: 100000
Growth Rate: 0.2

This generates what is essentially the classical logistic growth graph.

2. Chaotic growth

Initial population: 10000
Carrying capacity: 1000000
Groth Rate: 1.75

This is quintessential chaotic growth. It obviously has some order and periodicity, yet
examining the graph closer reveals that it never exactly repeats itself.

3. Population crash

Number of generations: 10
Initial Population: 10000
Carrying Capacity: 30000
Growth Rate: 2.7

This simulates a population that reproduces too fast for its own good and experiences
a massive crash to zero after it cannot sustain itself.

4. The Line

Initial population: 100
Carring capacity: 100
Growth rate: any

This illustrates a limitation of the model. In the real world, there would still be reproduction
and fluctuation even when the carrying capacity is exactly reached, though implementing this in
the model would inherently make it non-deterministic.

5. The spoomy boomy

Number of generations: 15
Initial population: 999
Carrying Capacity 1000
Growth Rate: 2.7

This is a population that destabilizes itself, creating larger and larger oscillations from the carrying
capacity until the population crashes to zero. 

6. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions

This one involves comparing two trials:

Initial population: 1000
Carrying Capacity: 1000000
Growth Rate: 1.7

Initial population: 1000
Carrying Capacity: 1000000
Growth Rate: 1.71

7. Island of Stability

Initial poulation: 1000
Carrying Capacity: 10000000
Growth Rate: 1.9

This shows surprising degrees of order and periodicity not expected of a growth rate this high. Trying a
growth rate just 0.1 lower or higher creates wildly different behavior. It just shows how the program has 
many hidden surpises that can be discovered with trial and error.
