# chaos-simulation

This is a deterministic mathematic model for population growth (and also coincidentally
the first real coding project the author has undertaken). It takes the assumptions of
the logistic growth model but shapes it to the real world by forcing new populations to 
be evaluated not continuously but discretely, on a generation-by-generation basis which
better mirrors real-world populations. Every parameter of the model is customizable,
allowing for various different scenarios to be modeled by the simulation. The ultimate
goal of the simulation is to create chaotic oscillations of a population to illustrate
that natural populations do not often just settle into a steady-state.

This was also created to supplement Eric Niu's 2025 second semester MVC final project at 
Amador Valley High School.
